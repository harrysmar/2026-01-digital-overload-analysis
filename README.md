# 2026-01 Digital Overload Analysis

This repository contains an early-stage data analysis project exploring digital overload and its potential relationship with vulnerable population groups.

The initial goal of the project was to investigate whether regions with higher proportions of elderly populations show different patterns in kiosk usage and digital accessibility indicators. 

The work focused on collecting and preprocessing multiple public datasets, integrating regional population statistics, and preparing analysis-ready data through several Jupyter notebooks.

During the research process, questions were raised about the clarity and feasibility of the research direction. 

Because of this, the project was paused before moving into full modeling and result interpretation.

The notebooks in this repository mainly document the data preprocessing pipeline and exploratory steps. 

Most notebook comments are written in Korean, as the work was originally developed for internal research.

This repository is kept as an archive of the early research stage and data preparation workflow.
