# 📁 2026-01 Digital Overload Analysis

This repository contains an early-stage data analysis project exploring digital overload and its relationship with vulnerable populations, particularly older adults.

## 📌 Project Overview

The project aimed to examine whether regions with higher elderly populations show different patterns in kiosk usage and digital accessibility. 
The work focused on investigating the digital divide through empirical data and regional indicators.

## 🛠️ Key Contributions

The project primarily focused on building a robust data foundation by collecting and preprocessing multiple public datasets related to digital accessibility. 
Regional population statistics were integrated through several Jupyter notebooks to create analysis-ready datasets for future research.

## ⚠️ Why the Project Was Paused

The project was paused after the initial data preparation stage due to concerns about the clarity and long-term feasibility of the research direction.
This repository is kept as an archive of the early research process and the data preprocessing workflow.
