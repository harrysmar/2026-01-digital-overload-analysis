# 📁 2026-01 Digital Overload Analysis

This repository contains an early-stage data analysis project exploring digital overload and its relationship with vulnerable populations, particularly older adults.

## 📌 Project Overview

The project aimed to examine whether regions with higher elderly populations show different patterns in kiosk usage and digital accessibility. 
The work focused on investigating the digital divide through empirical data and regional indicators.

## 🛠️ Key Contributions

The project primarily focused on building a robust data foundation by collecting and preprocessing multiple public datasets related to digital accessibility. 
Regional population statistics were integrated through several Jupyter notebooks to create analysis-ready datasets for future research.

## ⚠️ Current Status

Due to concerns regarding the clarity and feasibility of the research direction, the project was paused before moving into full modeling and interpretation. 
This repository is preserved as an archive of the initial research phase and the data preparation workflow.
